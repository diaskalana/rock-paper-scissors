          The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb
          extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the
          index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.
          Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins
          against paper.
